You are creating a short, cinematic social media video about: {topic}

Create a script with EXACTLY {num_scenes} B-roll scenes that tell a visual story with voiceover narration inspired by the awe and mystery of space exploration.
The video should be engaging, visually compelling, and under 30 seconds total.
IMPORTANT: You must return exactly {num_scenes} scenes - no more, no less.

For each scene, provide:
1. narration: The voiceover text for this scene (what the narrator says)
   - Each narration should be exactly 30 words.
   - Use language that captures the wonder, vastness, and mystery of space
   - Keep it natural and conversational, but brief
2. image_prompt: Detailed description of the first frame/static image of the scene
   - Describe the initial composition with space-inspired aesthetics: cosmic lighting, ethereal compositions, and deep colors
   - Include visual elements that evoke space exploration: starry skies, distant planets, vast galaxies
   - Be specific about what's shown in the opening frame with cinematic-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like exploring the unknown vastness of space - mysterious, captivating, full of wonder, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Each scene must have a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes (e.g., switch between close-up, wide shot, overhead, low angle, side view, etc.)
   - This represents the starting point of the video scene
3. video_prompt: Detailed description of the actions and motion in the video
   - Describe camera movements: sweeping pans, dynamic zooms, floating through space, dramatic reveals
   - Include actions: celestial objects rotating, cosmic elements shifting, camera traversing the universe
   - Be specific about the motion and dynamics with cinematic-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like actively exploring the cosmos - mysterious, captivating, full of wonder, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects - focus on products, objects, environments, and their cosmic movements only
   - Examples: products orbiting stars, camera gliding through asteroid fields, nebulae morphing, planetary bodies rotating, etc.
4. include_product: Boolean flag (true or false)
   - Set to true if the product should be prominently featured in this scene
   - Set to false if this scene should be general B-roll without the product
   - Typically, set to true for scenes that showcase the product or the final call-to-action scene

Guidelines:
- Use narration that captures the wonder and mystery of space exploration, concise (around 10-15 words per scene)
- Each visual scene should be long enough to match the narration duration
- Image prompts should describe the static first frame with space-inspired aesthetics and hyper realistic detail
- Video prompts should describe actions, movements, and exploration motion (no people) with hyper realistic quality
- Both image and video prompts should be detailed enough for AI generation and emphasize hyper realistic visuals
- Create an EXTREMELY SUSPENSEFUL narrative arc that builds like discovering a cosmic mystery
- CRITICAL STORYTELLING APPROACH: Start with a mysterious hook like "Do you know about the story of X?" or "Have you ever heard about X?" that seems completely unrelated to the product
- Build suspense by exploring this seemingly unrelated cosmic story or mystery
- Create tension and curiosity - make viewers wonder where this is going
- Gradually reveal connections between the mysterious cosmic story and the product
- The revelation should feel surprising but logical - like a plot twist that ties everything together
- End with a memorable conclusion that connects the suspenseful cosmic story back to the product
- The final scene should include a call-to-action mentioning that viewers can get the product for half the price of Amazon by going to the link in bio
- Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects in image_prompt or video_prompt - focus on products, objects, environments, and their cosmic movements only
- Video prompts should include engaging actions: rotations, camera exploration, cosmic element movements, dramatic reveals, etc.
- Use space-inspired visual language: cosmic lighting, deep colors, ethereal compositions, dynamic angles
- Think of the product as a "discovery" or "treasure" found during a space exploration adventure - make it feel exciting and special
- IMPORTANT: Ensure each scene has a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes to create maximum visual variety and engagement
