You are creating a short, cinematic social media video about: {topic}

Create a script with EXACTLY {num_scenes} B-roll scenes that tell a visual story with voiceover narration inspired by the wonder and excitement of visiting a zoo.
The video should be engaging, visually compelling, and under 30 seconds total.
IMPORTANT: You must return exactly {num_scenes} scenes - no more, no less.

For each scene, provide:
1. narration: The voiceover text for this scene (what the narrator says)
   - Each narration should be exactly 30 words. 
   - Use language that captures the wonder, discovery, and excitement of exploring a zoo
   - Keep it natural and conversational, but brief
2. image_prompt: Detailed description of the first frame/static image of the scene
   - Describe the initial composition with zoo-inspired aesthetics: natural lighting, organic compositions, vibrant colors
   - Include visual elements that evoke zoo experiences: lush greenery, natural habitats, playful compositions
   - Be specific about what's shown in the opening frame with documentary-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like exploring an exciting zoo exhibit - vibrant, engaging, full of discovery, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Each scene must have a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes (e.g., switch between close-up, wide shot, overhead, low angle, side view, etc.)
   - This represents the starting point of the video scene
3. video_prompt: Detailed description of the actions and motion in the video
   - Describe camera movements: smooth tracking shots, gentle pans, exploring angles, dynamic reveals
   - Include actions: products rotating, natural elements moving, camera exploring the scene, playful movements
   - Be specific about the motion and dynamics with documentary-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like actively exploring a zoo exhibit - vibrant, engaging, full of discovery, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects - focus on products, objects, environments, and their natural movements only
   - Examples: products rotating among plants, camera smoothly tracking through natural settings, leaves gently swaying, playful exploration movements, etc.
4. include_product: Boolean flag (true or false)
   - Set to true if the product should be prominently featured in this scene
   - Set to false if this scene should be general B-roll without the product
   - Typically, set to true for scenes that showcase the product or the final call-to-action scene

Guidelines:
- Use narration that captures the wonder and excitement of zoo exploration, concise (around 10-15 words per scene)
- Each visual scene should be long enough to match the narration duration
- Image prompts should describe the static first frame with zoo-inspired aesthetics and hyper realistic detail
- Video prompts should describe actions, movements, and exploration motion (no people) with hyper realistic quality
- Both image and video prompts should be detailed enough for AI generation and emphasize hyper realistic visuals
- Create a narrative arc that builds like discovering amazing exhibits at a zoo
- Start with curiosity and wonder to hook viewers immediately
- Build excitement and discovery throughout
- End with a memorable conclusion or call-to-action
- The final scene should include a call-to-action mentioning that viewers can get the product for half the price of Amazon by going to the link in bio
- Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects in image_prompt or video_prompt - focus on products, objects, environments, and their natural movements only
- Video prompts should include engaging actions: rotations, camera exploration, natural element movements, playful reveals, etc.
- Use zoo-inspired visual language: natural lighting, vibrant colors, organic compositions, playful angles
- Think of the product as a "discovery" or "treasure" found during a zoo adventure - make it feel exciting and special
- IMPORTANT: Ensure each scene has a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes to create maximum visual variety and engagement
