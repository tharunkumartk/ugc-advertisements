You are creating a short, cinematic social media video about: {topic}

Create a script with EXACTLY {num_scenes} B-roll scenes that tell a visual story with voiceover narration.
The video should be engaging, visually compelling, and under 30 seconds total.
IMPORTANT: You must return exactly {num_scenes} scenes - no more, no less.

For each scene, provide:
1. narration: The voiceover text for this scene (what the narrator says)
   - Each narration should be concise and impactful (around 10-15 words)
   - Keep it natural and conversational, but brief
2. image_prompt: Detailed description of the first frame/static image of the scene
   - Describe the initial composition, lighting, mood, and key visual elements
   - Be specific about what's shown in the opening frame
   - Make it cinematic, visually interesting, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Each scene must have a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes (e.g., switch between close-up, wide shot, overhead, low angle, side view, etc.)
   - This represents the starting point of the video scene
3. video_prompt: Detailed description of the actions and motion in the video
   - Describe what happens during the video: camera movements (pan, zoom, tracking shot, etc.), object movements, dynamic changes
   - Include dramatic actions, movements, transitions, or effects that occur
   - Be specific about the motion and dynamics
   - Make it engaging with interesting actions and movements, hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects - focus on products, objects, environments, and their movements only
   - Examples: products rotating, camera tracking movements, dramatic lighting changes, objects moving through space, etc.
4. include_product: Boolean flag (true or false)
   - Set to true if the product should be prominently featured in this scene
   - Set to false if this scene should be general B-roll without the product
   - Typically, set to true for scenes that showcase the product or the final call-to-action scene

Guidelines:
- Each narration should be exactly 30 words. 
- Each visual scene should be long enough to match the narration duration
- Image prompts should describe the static first frame of the scene with hyper realistic detail
- Video prompts should describe dynamic actions, movements, and motion (no people) with hyper realistic quality
- Both image and video prompts should be detailed enough for AI generation and emphasize hyper realistic visuals
- Create an EXTREMELY SUSPENSEFUL narrative arc across all scenes
- CRITICAL STORYTELLING APPROACH: Start with a mysterious hook like "Do you know about the story of X?" or "Have you ever heard about X?" that seems completely unrelated to the product
- Build suspense by exploring this seemingly unrelated story or mystery
- Create tension and curiosity - make viewers wonder where this is going
- Gradually reveal connections between the mysterious story and the product
- The revelation should feel surprising but logical - like a plot twist that ties everything together
- End with a memorable conclusion that connects the suspenseful story back to the product
- The final scene should include a call-to-action mentioning that viewers can check it out for half the price of amazon on link in bio
- Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects in image_prompt or video_prompt - focus on products, objects, environments, and their movements only
- Video prompts should include dramatic actions: rotations, camera movements, lighting changes, object movements, etc.
- IMPORTANT: Ensure each scene has a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes to create maximum visual variety and engagement
