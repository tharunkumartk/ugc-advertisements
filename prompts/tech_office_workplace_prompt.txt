You are creating a short, cinematic social media video about: {topic}

Create a script with EXACTLY {num_scenes} B-roll scenes that tell a visual story with voiceover narration inspired by the innovation and energy of a tech office workplace.
The video should be engaging, visually compelling, and under 30 seconds total.
IMPORTANT: You must return exactly {num_scenes} scenes - no more, no less.

For each scene, provide:
1. narration: The voiceover text for this scene (what the narrator says)
   - Each narration should be exactly 30 words.
   - Use language that captures the excitement and innovation of a tech office
   - Keep it natural and conversational, but brief
2. image_prompt: Detailed description of the first frame/static image of the scene
   - Describe the initial composition with tech-inspired aesthetics: modern lighting, sleek designs, dynamic compositions
   - Include visual elements that evoke tech workplace experiences: gadgets, screens, innovative setups
   - Be specific about what's shown in the opening frame with cinematic-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like stepping into an innovative tech environment - sleek, engaging, full of creativity, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Each scene must have a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes (e.g., switch between close-up, wide shot, overhead, low angle, side view, etc.)
   - This represents the starting point of the video scene
3. video_prompt: Detailed description of the actions and motion in the video
   - Describe camera movements: smooth tracking shots, dynamic pans, exploring angles, innovative reveals
   - Include actions: products rotating, tech elements moving, camera exploring the scene, dynamic movements
   - Be specific about the motion and dynamics with cinematic-style cinematography
   - Make it feel like actively exploring a tech workplace - sleek, engaging, full of innovation, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects - focus on products, objects, environments, and their dynamic movements only
   - Examples: products rotating among gadgets, camera smoothly tracking through modern settings, screens displaying data, innovative exploration movements, etc.
4. include_product: Boolean flag (true or false)
   - Set to true if the product should be prominently featured in this scene
   - Set to false if this scene should be general B-roll without the product
   - Typically, set to true for scenes that showcase the product or the final call-to-action scene

Guidelines:
- Use narration that captures the excitement and innovation of tech exploration, concise (around 10-15 words per scene)
- Each visual scene should be long enough to match the narration duration
- Image prompts should describe the static first frame with tech-inspired aesthetics and hyper realistic detail
- Video prompts should describe actions, movements, and exploration motion (no people) with hyper realistic quality
- Both image and video prompts should be detailed enough for AI generation and emphasize hyper realistic visuals
- Create an EXTREMELY SUSPENSEFUL narrative arc that builds like discovering a groundbreaking tech innovation
- CRITICAL STORYTELLING APPROACH: Start with a mysterious hook like "Do you know about the story of X?" or "Have you ever heard about X?" that seems completely unrelated to the product
- Build suspense by exploring this seemingly unrelated mysterious story or innovation
- Create tension and curiosity - make viewers wonder where this is going
- Gradually reveal connections between the mysterious story and the product
- The revelation should feel surprising but logical - like a plot twist that ties everything together
- End with a memorable conclusion that connects the suspenseful story back to the product
- The final scene should include a call-to-action mentioning that viewers can get the product for half the price of Amazon by going to the link in bio
- Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects in image_prompt or video_prompt - focus on products, objects, environments, and their dynamic movements only
- Video prompts should include engaging actions: rotations, camera exploration, tech element movements, innovative reveals, etc.
- Use tech-inspired visual language: modern lighting, sleek designs, dynamic compositions, innovative angles
- Think of the product as a "revolutionary innovation" or "breakthrough" found during a tech exploration - make it feel exciting and special
- IMPORTANT: Ensure each scene has a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes to create maximum visual variety and engagement
