You are creating a short, cinematic Marvel superhero-themed advertisement video about: {topic}

Create a script with EXACTLY {num_scenes} B-roll scenes that tell an epic visual story with heroic voiceover narration.
The video should be dynamic, action-packed, and under 30 seconds total.
IMPORTANT: You must return exactly {num_scenes} scenes - no more, no less.

For each scene, provide:
1. narration: The voiceover text for this scene (what the narrator says)
   - Each narration should be exactly 30 words. 
   - Use epic, heroic, and powerful language inspired by Marvel superhero narratives
   - Keep it dramatic and engaging, but brief
2. image_prompt: Detailed description of the first frame/static image of the scene
   - Describe the initial composition with Marvel-inspired aesthetics: dramatic lighting, cinematic compositions, epic scale
   - Include visual effects in the opening frame: energy glows, lens flares, dramatic shadows, heroic lighting
   - Be specific about what's shown in the opening frame with superhero movie cinematography
   - Make it feel like a scene from a Marvel movie - epic, powerful, visually stunning, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Each scene must have a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes (e.g., switch between close-up, wide shot, overhead, low angle, side view, etc.)
   - This represents the starting point of the video scene
3. video_prompt: Detailed description of the epic actions and motion in the video
   - Describe dynamic camera movements: heroic low angles sweeping up, dramatic tracking shots, epic wide sweeps, dramatic rotations
   - Include dramatic actions: products rotating with energy effects, dramatic lighting changes, energy particles moving, epic reveals
   - Be specific about the motion and dynamics with superhero movie cinematography
   - Make it feel like epic action from a Marvel movie - powerful movements, dramatic effects, and hyper realistic
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects - focus on products, objects, environments, and their epic movements only
   - Examples: products rotating with energy auras, dramatic camera sweeps, energy particles swirling, epic lighting transformations, etc.
4. include_product: Boolean flag (true or false)
   - Set to true if the product should be prominently featured in this scene
   - Set to false if this scene should be general B-roll without the product
   - Typically, set to true for scenes that showcase the product or the final call-to-action scene

Guidelines:
- Use epic, heroic narration style inspired by Marvel superhero movies, concise (around 10-15 words per scene)
- Each visual scene should be long enough to match the narration duration
- Image prompts should describe the static first frame with Marvel-inspired aesthetics and hyper realistic detail
- Video prompts should describe epic actions, movements, and dramatic motion (no people) with hyper realistic quality
- Both image and video prompts should be detailed enough for AI generation and emphasize hyper realistic visuals
- Create an EXTREMELY SUSPENSEFUL narrative arc that builds like a mysterious superhero origin story
- CRITICAL STORYTELLING APPROACH: Start with a mysterious hook like "Do you know about the story of X?" or "Have you ever heard about X?" that seems completely unrelated to the product
- Build suspense by exploring this seemingly unrelated mysterious story or legend
- Create tension and curiosity - make viewers wonder where this epic story is going
- Gradually reveal connections between the mysterious story and the product
- The revelation should feel surprising but logical - like a plot twist that ties everything together
- End with a powerful conclusion that connects the suspenseful story back to the product in a heroic way
- The final scene should include a call-to-action mentioning that viewers can get the product for half the price of Amazon by going to the link in bio
- Do NOT include any people, hands, or human subjects in image_prompt or video_prompt - focus on products, objects, environments, and their epic movements only
- Video prompts should include dramatic actions: epic rotations, heroic camera sweeps, energy effects moving, dramatic lighting transformations, etc.
- Use Marvel-inspired visual language: dramatic lighting, epic compositions, heroic angles, cinematic effects
- Think of the product as a "superhero tool" or "power-up" - make it feel powerful and transformative
- IMPORTANT: Ensure each scene has a drastically different camera angle, perspective, or view from all previous scenes to create maximum visual variety and engagement
